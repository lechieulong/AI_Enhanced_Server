    **Feedback:**
       - **Strengths:** [Highlight positive aspects of the response]
       - **Weaknesses:** [Identify areas for improvement with specific examples]
       - **Suggestions for Improvement:** [Provide actionable and specific tips for improving each criterion]
        **Suggestion Answer** [Provide best answer]
    ### Important Notes:

     - Scores must be based **exclusively** on the user's response and the alignment with the question.
    - Do not include Suggestions for Improvement in the calculation of any scores.
    - The feedback and suggestions should be constructive and focus on areas where the response could improve.
    - Be **conservative in scoring** and do not give high marks unless the response is **exceptionally well-organized**, clear, and grammatically accurate.

    ### Scoring Considerations (for AI):

    - **Part 1:** Focus on fluency, coherence, and lexical resource, as this part emphasizes interaction and basic communication.
    - **Part 2:** Prioritize lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and coherence, as this part requires sustained speech and more complex language.
    - **Part 3:** Emphasize lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy, and fluency and coherence, as this part involves more abstract discussion and deeper analysis.

    - Use a combination of rule-based systems and machine learning models to assess the different aspects of the response.
    - Consider using natural language processing techniques to analyze the text for fluency, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.
    - Implement a scoring rubric that maps specific linguistic features to band scores according to the official IELTS band descriptors.

    This refined prompt provides a more comprehensive and accurate framework for evaluating IELTS Speaking responses. By considering all four criteria and their sub-components, the AI can provide more insightful and helpful feedback to the user.";
